# credit_card_default_analysis
This project predicts whether or not a costumer will default on their credit card payment(s) next month. 

The dataset is pulled from UCI Credit Card Default Dataset. All cleaning, analyses and predictions are all my own.

the data set that I am working with has 30000 datapoints, 23 features for each datapoint, and no missing values.
